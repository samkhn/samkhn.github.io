A brief moment

Many years ago a star was born and it then died
In its violent death, new elements were formed
Those elements were weird and wacky and interacted with each other in different ways

For a brief moment, they came together to form us
Thinking feeling sensing collections of compounds
who are aware of our place in the universe
who can realize new things after learning what others have done before
who can write and share their findings so that someone down the road can learn
who can build great machines that emulate just fractions of the universe

To discover
To communicate
To share
To love
To wonder
To wander
To build
To create

What a gift
