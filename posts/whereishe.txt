Where is He?

I trained to be in His service.
I bowed.
I bore my soul.
I let Him in my heart.
I sacrificed what I could.

But where is He?
Our children die and suffer. 
His followers perish in unholy fires.
The evil bear the riches of His dominion.
Sin, corruption, heresy to make the demons blush.

Why does He need to test?
If He must test, He is not all knowing.
If He is omnipotent, why does He let his followers die?
If He cannot teach without killing His followers, He can't be omnipotent.
If his vision for the world means I must kill others in his service, then his vision is not all good.

I wished to be his soldier.
To repent. Bare my sins.
To sacrifice. All of mine is his.
To pray. Unwavering. 

But I cannot see him. Has he forsaken us? If he can build us in a week, what is stopping him from tearing us down in a week?

I will be my own soldier.
I will tend to my own garden.
I will create and foster all life. 
I will pay penance to those I hurt by healing and repairing, not by communion with him.
I will sacrifice what I can to help those in need who come to my garden. So that we may all enjoy the fruits of our world.
I will pray to my people and home and for my people and home.
