<ul>
<li> err towards not making decisions, especially ones you can't reverse </li>
<li> only keep a policy if the benefit it brings exceeds its cost/waste </li>
<li> hunt down slow-feedback loops. get to a YES/NO quickly </li>
<li> talk to users, when you do, practice a healthy degree of skepticism </li>
<li> have clear critical user journeys </li>
<li> break down large CUJs into smaller ones </li>
<li> measurements can be gamed so have a mix of quantitative and qualitative CUJs </li>
<li> if you do measure CUJs, verify metrics are met </li>
<li> finish features before starting new ones </li>
<li> update backlog with current work-in-progress </li>
<li> routinely work on bug fixes while doing feature work, especially of critical bugs </li>
<li> if possible, reduce scope and/or extend deadlines if its overbearing </li>
<li> start simple and iterate </li>
<li> learn to say no </li>
<li> don't multitask. if you must, limit it as much as possible </li>
<li> use the best tooling, understand your tools: the underlying architecture, core language libraries, basic data structures and algorithms, loggers, debuggers, profilers
<li> replace hard to use libraries </li>
<li> write fast and accurate tests. every commit should have tests. </li>
<li> write fast and reliable builds. build every day </li>
<li> make root cause analysis easy </li>
<li> document your software. treat it like software </li>
<li> use pair programming, especially between junior and senior engineers </li>
<li> create an environment where team members can speak/share </li>
<li> practice blameless postmortems </li>
<li> practice conversation turn taking. explicitly ask quiet folks for input either in the meeting or later according to their comfort </li>
<li> do synchronous face to face checkups </li>
</ul>
