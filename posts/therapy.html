    <h3> Context and meta learning </h3>
	<p>
	Therapy, ideally, is hyper tailored to your case. Unfortunately, that may not always be possible or accessible, primarily due to costs.
	I want to share some things I learned in my conversations with my psychologist/therapist.
	These are concepts and practices that worked for me but may not work for you. I encourage you to try and apply them but YMMV.
	My parents provided food and shelter but quite literally told me I'll have to figure everything else out. This is for those people.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note: The following concepts can be grouped together under what is known as ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy).
	</p>

	<h3> Your mind is a story teller </h3>
	<p>
	Your brain is responsible for a lot of things. One of them is to take stimuli and unconsciously process it. e.g. you aren't always actively searching for predators but your brain noticed that the grass was rustling.
	One set of signals are social signals. What people say are signals for your social standing and reputation which impacts how likely your group might kick you out.
	People throughout your life have said things to you and your mind will absorb those statements as information and begin generating thoughts that reflect them.
	e.g. if your parents or strangers have commented about your weight or height, your mind takes those signals in even if your conscious mind is ignoring it.
	This signal processing is entirely automatic. These thoughts and stories, however, can often feed into unproductive and sometimes harmful core beliefs.
	e.g. if your brain generates the thought that "I am not good...", a core belief will impact whether that thought becomes "I am not good [but can improve]" vs "I am not good [and never will be]".
	You may not have a choice over these core beliefs or how your brain generates thoughts but you have a choice over who you want to be and over how these core beliefs and thoughts influence you.
	You are not your thoughts. However, it is a lot of work and practice to align yourself with who you are and not be aligned with core beliefs and thoughts.
	</p>

	<h4> Over intellectualizing </h4>
	<p>
	My mind, in particular, did an excellent job creating stories and rationalizations for why I was experiencing emotional hurt.
	At the peak of my depression, I was very withdrawn. I would rarely reach out to my friends. I would stay in my apartment all day.
	My mind would rationalize it as "my friends are busy and probably can't make the time for me." This was...technically true. However, the resulting action was that I didn't even try (because failure was inevitable).
	A nasty undercurrent here was that I held the core belief that "I would die alone/I am unlovable". I didn't consciously say it but my friends not making the time for me supported that core belief that I was fundamentally unlovable.
	Another flavor of this is over-intellectualizing depression itself. I knew I was depressed and thought if I understood the science behind it, I can think my way out of the negative thought patterns.
	However, because thinking against your thought generating mind requires constant attention, this was an unsustainable approach. My conscious mind needed to focus on other things as well.
	You cannot outthink your depression, no matter how smart you think you are.
	</p>
	<p>
	...so what can you do?
	</p>

	<h3> Your toolbox </h3>
	You have four tools: acceptance, cognitive diffusion, mindfulness, and activity. Acceptance, cognitive diffusion and mindfulness are your triage kit. Activity is your long term hedge against it.
	When I say practice, I mean literally sit down and write it down.

	<h4> Acceptance </h4>
	<p>
	Acceptance is the practice of accepting our thoughts and feelings of discomfort without judgement.
	Our mind will generate thoughts that will often distort reality. You use conscious acceptance as a way to address this distortions.
	It's exhausting to fight reality and it doesn't work. Delusions cause setbacks and more suffering down the road.
Some common acceptance techniques:
<ul>
<li>
curious child := notice where the feeling is in your body.
Zoom in on it. Observe it as if you were a child that never encountered it before.
Where are the edges? Where does it start and where does it end? Is it on the surface or inside? Hot or cold? Light or heavy?
</li>
<li>
noticing/mindful naming := Notice where the feeling is. Notice where it is most intense.
Label the feeling mindfully "I'm noticing anxiety. Here is sadness. I am feeling anger."
</li>
<li>
breathe into the feeling := let your breath flow into and around it.
</li>
<li>
allow := give yourself permission to feel it through. You don't have to like it or want it. Just allow it.
</li>
<li>
compassion := hold this feeling gently and softly as if it's a crying baby or scared puppy.
</li>
<li>
pain is your ally and teacher := use this emotion to motivate, communicate and illuminate.
</li>
</ul>
	</p>

	<h4> Cognitive diffusion </h4>
	<p>
Cognitive fusion occurs when we buy into and believe what the mind says.
This can become a problem if the thought is deeply unproductive
e.g. the thought "I will die alone" leads people to take actions that align with this belief, such as self sabotaging and never asking people out
Cognitive fusion comes in six flavors:
<ol>
<li>
rules, especially those that make you inflexible
</li>
<li>
reasons, excuses for why change isn't possible e.g. I'm unlucky and lazy and won't change
</li>
<li>
judgement either yourself too negatively e.g. I'm too incompetent, or others too highly e.g. putting a crush on a pedestal
</li>
<li>
past fuse, attaching to positive or negative memories e.g. reminiscing about an ex-partner
</li>
<li>
future fuse, attaching to positive or negative thoughts about the future e.g. the world is going to end
</li>
<li>
self, such as attaching to stories that we tell ourselves e.g. you are a monster.
</li>
</ol>
Here is how to practice cognitive diffusion:
<ul>
<li>
notice and disentagle:

  Witness and disentangle yourself from harmful self talk.

  Observe your thoughts, don't think from them.

  You are not your thoughts. let your thoughts flow by (like cars on a road).
</li>
<li>
name the story and have you seen it before?:

  if the thoughts were formed into a story, what would you call it.

  have you seen it before? How old is the thought? 
</li>
<li>
workability:

  Is the thought useful?

  If you bought into it, would you be better?

  Would you behave as a person you want to be?
</li>
<li>
you are in pain and your mind is trying to make sense of it by forming a story based on what you know and what you are seeing.

  These solutions can be effective sometimes but other times things can be too complicated and your mind forms an ineffective solution/theory.
</li>
<li>
practice compassion for yourself.

  This universe is hard on all of us. You no less.

  Given your biology, what you've been through, given what your loved ones have been through, does it make sense that they'd say something like that?
</li>
</ul>
</p>

	<h4> Mindfullness </h4>
	<p>
breathe. Disengage from racing thoughts. Bring yourself back to the present moment.
Two tools here
<ol>
<li>
engage your skills/abilities to the present moment
</li>
<li>
if possible, savor a present activity (reward). Aka do something now with your whole mind and reward yourself.
</li>
</ol>
	</p>

	<h4> Activity </h4>
	By far the most effective treatment for me.
	<p>
	Find an activity that you <b>do</b> that can act as a flywheel for the rest of the day.
	Depression is a cycle of inactivity. You are depressed -> you don't do anything -> you are low-energy, thought -> you are depressed.
	You need to jolt out of this cycle.
	For me it is running and exercise outdoors. Sunlight and movement are the foundation of my strategy against depression.
	After sometime, I am now able to sense that I am falling back into a depressive loop and that's when I know that I must get outside and just run.
	This activity doesn't have to be exercise. It can just be a walk, a shower, writing in your journal/planner. But it needs to demonstratably help you with another thing you want to do.
	The flywheel for me is: sun, exercise (heart racing, muscle tiring), cold shower, breathe, sit straight, plan, visualize, engineer (build, test, release, fix), share (engineering findings, thoughts, feelings), serve (your loved ones, your community), connect, volunteer, help.
	I hope you can find your flywheel as well.
	</p>

	<h3> Observations made after </h3>

	<h4> Controlling signals </h4>
	<p>
	It is important that you control the media you consume. In the same way what you eat impacts your physical energy level and how you can go about your day, what you consume media wise (who you listen to, what you read and watch) impacts what kind of thoughts you generate down the road.
	This is a prevelant issue with those who call themselves incels or are in the manosphere. They are in a room of people who repeat horrifying observations and beliefs and they repeat them.
	An effective antidote for these folks is to walk outside and observe what's actually happening in the real world: couples and people from varying backgrounds are forming relationships, not engaging in hypergamy.
	When I was at the peak of my depression, I would listen to Hippo Campus's Bambi, a song that does a pretty good job of capturing my depression (inactivity, barely holding on, feeling guilty for being suicidal and putting my friends through it).
	While it felt good to hear acknowledgement, it'd place me in a depressive trance and distract me from what I needed to: to go see my friends and talk about it. Activity was the antidote.
	This is also prevalent in circles that consume social media as news. News organizations have been forced to compete for attention with social media platforms. As a result, news organizations have replicated the same pattern of releasing only negative news.
	People who then consume only negative news will experience a distorted perception of what is going on (fusing to beliefs such as the world is ending, for instance).
	Social media and media only really prioritize engagement. Pain and sadness engages, thus, most recommendation algorithms propogate it.
	When a majority of the signals you consume are negative, you will begin generating negative thoughts. These negative thoughts might not to fall back into depressive routines but it certainly doesn't help.
	Some actionable steps: cut out social media alltogether. For what you can't cut out, curate your section of the algorithm. This means explicitly blocking content you know is negative, using extensions like FeedEradicator, reducing your feed subscriptions to content you know nourishes you. For me, I deleted all YouTube subscriptions except for university lectures, industry conferences, and scientists/mathematicians who are tenured (unfortunately, untenured professors also try to game the algorithm as well).
	</p>

	<h4> Safety </h4>
	<p>
	This is an obvious one: people want safety. However, I had the problem of fusing to the belief that I was a risk taker because many engineers I looked up to were risk takers.
	In reality, they weren't but I was tricked into believing this because of the weird amount of "rise-and-grind" media.
	I grew up poor. While I wanted to be a risk taker, entrepreneur, what I fundamentally needed was safety. I wanted to be flush with cash so that my mom could grow the tomatoes she's always wanted and so we could say we own a home.
	When I was growing up, I loved physics and math. Physics was hard but I enjoyed it so much I wanted to be a theroretical physicist. I tried to build my own particle accelerator but obviously ran into cost issues. I err'ed towards building rail guns, burning through about 50 capacitors to lug a small piece of metal across the room.
	I dreamed of particles. I "saw" the neutrinos passing through my thumb. I "saw" the dance of electrons around their nucleus.
	But when the question of career came into question, I became practical and stopped dreaming. My dreams didn't die but they became quiet in the face of my desire to bring safety to my family.
	Early on, I pariticipated in Google CSSI, a program targeted at high school students to convince them to do computer science. Upon learning about theoretical CS and Google's idea of the planet sized computer, I drank up the juice. I got the best of both worlds: I get to build machines that test the limits of computing and I get to earn money to feed my parents. Computer science is a form of applied math so I got my math fix.
	However, my love of physics and the desire to understand the universe was never explored. I'm happy to say my need for safety didn't override my desire to understand the universe. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I regret not commiting to math or physics.
	</p>

	<h4> Projecting pain </h4>
	<p>
	Another obvious one: people want to be heard, especially if they are in pain. Often times, when someone is mean to you or just rude to others, they have experienced hurt and were never given the space to process it.
	e.g. short men need to die. For many many years, women were held to an unnatural standard of expectations (e.g. be both fat and thin). The phrase "short men need to die" is a reflection of that pain back at men for those standards. When women expressed that pain, men/husbands would "discipline" their partners to silence them. When women would complain, they'd be given drugs to mellow out instead of having their needs met. The line "short men need to die" is extreme but the collective hurt under it is also extreme.
	People need to express their pain. Instead of punishing them, it is fundamentally better to hear them out and help them process it. Create a shared and safe context where they will not be judged for their thoughts. Bear their pain with them.
